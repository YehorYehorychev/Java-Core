Hello World! and how is it different to poetry?
The short answer is that prose is the form of writing
that I'm using now, and the form we most commonly use
in speech with each other. Prose is the term for any
sustained wodge of text that doesn't have a
consistent rhythm.

Poetry or verse is different: verse has a set
rhythm (or meter), and it looks distinctive
on the page as the lines are usually shorter
than prose

 His palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy
There's vomit on his sweater already, mom's spaghetti
He's nervous, but on the surface, he looks calm and ready
