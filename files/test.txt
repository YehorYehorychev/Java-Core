I see niggas in this bitch stunting, popping bottles
Getting drunk with these bitches
Then when they leave, 4566 they get followed
Fall asleep with that bitch
And really don't know much about her
Then she let us in, we take all of your shit
And when you wake up, she help you try to find it, I love her

I be with bitches that be with bitches
That be with niggas with riches
I tell 22 her, "Get him," she say, "I got you"
I say, "No, bitch, I said get him" (Ha)
And they so pretty, and they hair lengthy
He hit it and sleep on her titties
Then she give us the word, we come through with AKs
It's a stick-up, she scream like a victim, now you
Feeling so silly, I smoke color purple
I'm up in here feeling like Celie, ooh
Nappy-ass dreads, what's that you say 666?
Watch your mouth, Milli Vanilli, ooh
You can get snaked, you can get faked
Out by the bitch that you feeling 'cause you
Thought that she was an angel, that bitch ain't no angel
I treat her halo like a frisbee, and you
Tell her your business, she tell me your business
You tell that bitch what you feeling
All of the beans you be spilling, 7 to you
She lie through her teeth; cavities, fillings
She know where you hide it, tell me where it's hidden
She know when you gone, tell me when to visit
We break in your home and take the specifics
And meanwhile, the bitch 12446677 is on vacation with him
So she don't get blamed, we don't snatch chains
We find out addresses, and we don't leave messes
You'll only know  33333555576868 that it's gone when you checking
Then your first thought is to start second guessing
She say, "What's wrong?" He say, "Nothing, keep resting,"
She say, "What's missing?"â€”"How you know something missing?"
He scratched his 878 head, she say, "Get back in bed,"
Then she gave him some head, boy, you can't trust them bitches
And then she say, "Ooh"
